## 📝 Internship Work Summary

As part of my 8-week internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**, under the guidance of **Neela Santosh**, I developed a responsive weather application named **Rain or Shine** using fundamental web technologies. The primary objective of this task was to strengthen my front-end development skills by building a fully functional, user-interactive application that integrates with a third-party API and offers a smooth user experience.

I began by identifying the right API for real-time weather data and chose the **OpenWeatherMap API** for its ease of use and comprehensive weather information. I registered for the API key and studied the documentation to understand how to make HTTP requests to retrieve both current weather and forecast data for any city in the world.

Using **HTML5**, I built the structure of the single-page application (SPA), ensuring semantic clarity and accessibility. I then used **CSS3** along with **Bootstrap 5** to create a clean and responsive layout that adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones.

The core functionality was handled using **Vanilla JavaScript**. I implemented features to allow users to search for a city, which triggered API calls using `fetch()`. The application then displayed the temperature, weather condition, humidity, and icons representing the weather visually. I added another section to display a **short-term forecast**, providing users with upcoming hourly predictions, which required parsing and formatting the forecast data received from the API.

I focused on user experience by incorporating smooth animations, error handling for invalid city names, and loading indicators. Additionally, I ensured that the application remained lightweight and fast, following best practices in coding, such as modular JavaScript and minimal DOM manipulation.

Throughout the development, I regularly pushed updates to GitHub, practiced version control, and deployed the project using **GitHub Pages** to make it publicly accessible. The internship helped me reinforce my skills in building real-time, API-based applications and boosted my confidence in front-end development within the **MERN stack domain**, especially the `M` (MongoDB) and `E` (Express.js) portions that I explored in other tasks.

This project taught me how to work independently, debug efficiently, and communicate technical progress effectively with my mentor. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that enhanced both my technical and soft skills, preparing me for larger full-stack applications in the MERN ecosystem.
