## 📝 Project Description

During my internship at CodTech IT Solutions, under the mentorship of Neela Santosh, I developed a responsive weather web application titled Rain or Shine. This single-page application was designed to fetch and display real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The goal was to enhance my front-end development skills while building an interactive and API-driven web tool.

To begin, I researched various public weather APIs and selected OpenWeatherMap for its rich dataset and developer-friendly documentation. After setting up the API key, I familiarized myself with its endpoints, response formats, and usage limits. I planned the app structure and user interface layout to make the application clean, modern, and mobile-friendly.

I started the development with HTML5 to create a semantic and accessible layout. Then, using CSS3 and Bootstrap 5, I styled the page with a responsive grid system to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes. Emphasis was placed on making the user interface visually intuitive and easy to navigate.

The interactive functionality of the app was built using Vanilla JavaScript. I implemented event listeners to handle user input, such as city search queries. Upon submission, the app made asynchronous API calls using the fetch() method to retrieve both the current weather data and the short-term hourly forecast. I handled the API responses by parsing the JSON data and dynamically updating the DOM with weather details such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and corresponding icons.

One of the key aspects of development was ensuring error handling. I added conditions to display appropriate messages when users entered invalid city names or when API errors occurred. This helped create a robust and user-friendly experience.

To improve visual feedback and user engagement, I incorporated subtle animations during content updates. I also structured the JavaScript in a modular way for better maintainability and code readability. Once the core functionality was complete, I thoroughly tested the application on various devices and browsers to ensure consistent performance.

The completed application was deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible as a live demo. Throughout the development, I practiced version control by committing changes regularly to my GitHub repository.

Working on this project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with integrating APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript, and creating real-time web interfaces. It also helped me understand the importance of user experience design, responsive layout strategies, and clean code practices.

Overall, this project strengthened my confidence in front-end web development and gave me a practical understanding of how to build dynamic, API-powered applications using core web technologies. The experience was valuable in reinforcing the foundational skills required in the MERN stack development path.
